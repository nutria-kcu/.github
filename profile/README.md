# Team Nutria 
## Welcome to the official GitHub of Nutria! üëã

We are a passionate team of developers and programmers dedicated to learning and exploring the depths of software engineering and reverse engineering techniques. Our focus is on creating programs for educational purposes, where we aim to understand game mechanics, security systems, and how game developers protect their creations from exploitation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What We Do
At Nutria, we engage in creating educational projects that demonstrate how certain game mechanics can be manipulated for research and learning. 
We do not promote or condone cheating in live or competitive games. Our tools are intended strictly for educational purposes, 

including:

* Understanding game security systems
* Learning reverse engineering techniques
* Exploring game mechanics
* Research into anti-cheat systems

We believe in learning by doing and taking a deep dive into how games work on the inside.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Our Ethos
* Ethical Research: All our projects are meant to be used in a controlled, private, and ethical manner. We never encourage the use of these tools in online or competitive environments.
* Educational Purpose: Our main goal is to educate ourselves and others about how software interacts with games and how developers protect their code.
* No Harm: We aim to never cause harm to any developers or game companies. Our focus is entirely on learning and research.
