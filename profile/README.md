# Nutria Team
## Welcome to the official GitHub profile of Nutria! üëã

We are a passionate team of developers and programmers dedicated to learning and exploring the depths of software engineering and reverse engineering techniques. Our focus is on creating programs for educational purposes, where we aim to understand game mechanics, security systems, and how game developers protect their creations from exploitation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What We Do
At Nutria, we engage in creating educational projects that demonstrate how certain game mechanics can be manipulated for research and learning. We do not promote or condone cheating in live or competitive games. Our tools are intended strictly for educational purposes, including:

Understanding game security systems
Learning reverse engineering techniques
Exploring game mechanics
Research into anti-cheat systems
We believe in learning by doing and taking a deep dive into how games work on the inside.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Our Ethos
Ethical Research: All our projects are meant to be used in a controlled, private, and ethical manner. We never encourage the use of these tools in online or competitive environments.
Educational Purpose: Our main goal is to educate ourselves and others about how software interacts with games and how developers protect their code.
No Harm: We aim to never cause harm to any developers or game companies. Our focus is entirely on learning and research.
## üõ†Ô∏è Projects
Here are some of our current and past projects:

Game Cheating Simulator: A simple program to demonstrate basic principles of game mechanics manipulation for educational purposes.
Anti-Cheat Bypass: Research project exploring common anti-cheat methods, how they work, and ways to improve game security.
Reverse Engineering Toolkit: A toolkit aimed at helping learners understand how to reverse-engineer basic game code in a legal and safe manner.
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
Please note that the use of any of the software created by Nutria should be done with caution and respect for the terms and conditions of the games and platforms you engage with. We do not support or encourage using any of our tools in live or online environments without permission.
